These steps are meant to provide transparency instead of running installers which works magically sometimes but more frustrating 
when it doesn't. Let's begin!


#### Steps

1. To copy fonts and keyboards to your computer, run the following command in your Terminal app

        curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imechemi/monlam-bodyig/master/mac/install.sh | bash


2. Go to **System Preferences** -> **Keyboard Preferences...** -> **Input Sources**


3. Then click '+' button, choose **others** and select **Monlam Bod-yig 3.00**. Then, click 'Add'
